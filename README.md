# CsGamesWebPlayer
Web Video Player created for CsGames Web Dev Competition.
The aim of the competition was to create a web video player platform similar to YouTube in under 3 hours.
Due to the time constrain this repository is very basic but shows our progress in the competition.

The following pages were able to be mostly completed:
1. Home Page
2. Sign up Page
3. Log in Page
4. Profile Edit Page
5. Single Video Player Page

The web application uses HTML/CSS/PHP for the front end, and MySQL for the back end database.
